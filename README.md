A simple tool for cleaning census entries in our annual 2b2t census.
to use this tool create a file called ``in.txt`` in root directory and fill it with entries split by a newline. then just fire up the program and use it to clean the enties. 
all entries will be in ``out.txt`` which will be created, if such file exists in the root directory of this program than it will be overriden.
